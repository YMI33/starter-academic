abstract: The arbitrariness of composite analysis due to criterion of defining
  positive and negative events is an unsolved problem. To deal with it, a new
  method based on the covariance and defined as weighted composite analysis was
  developed in this study. Two ideal cases reveal that the new method can
  eliminate noise more effectively in small sample size, and has a higher signal
  to noise ratio than the traditional method in some cases. And a real case on
  the relationship between ENSO and geopotential height over East Asia in summer
  indicates that the new method shows some similar features with composite
  analyses, but can effectually avoid some inappropriate conclusions. It
  therefore provides an alternative approach to investigate linkages between
  different variables.
