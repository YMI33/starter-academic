abstract: We introduce a newly developed global ice sheet model coupled to the
  Globally Resolved Energy Balance (GREB) climate model for the simulation of
  global ice sheet evolution on time scales of 100 kyr or longer (GREB-ISM
  v0.3). Ice sheets and ice shelves are simulated on a global grid, fully
  interacting with the climate simulation of surface temperature, precipitation,
  albedo, land-sea mask, topography and sea level. Thus, it is a fully coupled
  atmosphere, ocean, land and ice sheet model. We test the model in ice sheet
  stand-alone and fully coupled simulations. The ice sheet model dynamics behave
  similarly to other hybrid SIA (Shallow Ice Approximation) and SSA (Shallow
  Shelf Approximation) models, but the West Antarctic Ice Sheet accumulates too
  much ice using present-day boundary conditions. The coupled model simulations
  produce global equilibrium ice sheet volumes and calving rates similar to
  observed for present day boundary conditions. We designed a series of
  idealised experiments driven by oscillating solar radiation forcing on periods
  of 20 kyr, 50 kyr and 100 kyr in the Northern Hemisphere. These simulations
  show clear interactions between the climate system and ice sheets, resulting
  in slow build-up and fast decay of ice-covered areas and global ice volume.
  The results also show that Northern Hemisphere ice sheets respond more
  strongly to time scales longer than 100 kyr. The coupling to the atmosphere
  and sea level leads to climate interactions between the Northern and Southern
  Hemispheres. The model can run global simulations of 100 kyr per day on a
  desktop computer, allowing the simulation of the whole Quaternary period (2.6
  Myrs) within one month.
